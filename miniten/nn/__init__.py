"""
Neural Network Module - Building Blocks for Deep Learning Models

This module provides neural network layers, activation functions, and model containers.

Submodules:
- layers: Common neural network layers (Linear, Conv2d, LSTM, etc.)
- activations: Activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, etc.)
- modules: Base classes for building custom modules
- containers: Model containers (Sequential, ModuleList, etc.)
- cnn: Convolutional Neural Network components
- rnn: Recurrent Neural Network components (RNN, LSTM, GRU)
- gnn: Graph Neural Network components
- attention: Attention mechanisms and Transformers

All implementations are optimized for edge devices with minimal memory footprint.
